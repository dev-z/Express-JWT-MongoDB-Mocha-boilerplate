# Express-JWT-MongoDB-Mocha-boilerplate [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dev-z/Express-JWT-MongoDB-Mocha-boilerplate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dev-z/Express-JWT-MongoDB-Mocha-boilerplate)
Quickstart your projects with this API server Boilerplate. Uses ExpressJS, MongoDB, JWT, Mocha & Chai.

## What is this repository for?

* Create a RESTful API server within minutes.
* Uses ExpressJS API Framework and MongoDB as database.
* Uses JWT for authenticating incoming requests.
* Uses Mocha and Chai for testing
* Uses ESLint and Airbnb JS style-guide to help write standard and clean code.
* OpenAPI 3.0 documentation

## How do I get set up?

### There are many ways to get this project up and running:
### 1. Using Docker
* Clone the repo to your local machine
* Dependencies: docker, docker-compose
* cd to the project root folder
* Create .env file with the required values. (See Creating .env file)
* Run the following command:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

> This is the easiest way to get up and running as you won't have to install nodejs, mongoDB or Redis. Everything is run using containers.

Docker-compose has been set up to detect and reflect changes as you save them. No need to rebuild or restart the containers.

To stop everything, simply run:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### 2. Run Locally on your machine
* Clone the repo to your local machine.
* Dependencies: nodejs v6.4.x+, npm v 5.5.x
* cd to the project root folder
* Create .env file with the required values. (See Creating .env file)
* Uncomment the first line in `server.js` file which is something like this:
`require('dotenv').config();`
* Run the following commands in terminal:
```bash
# install the dependencies
npm install

# run the server
npm start
```

### Accessing the api docs
Once your server is up and running, you can access the documentation at http://host:port/api/v1/api-docs/

## Creating .env file

This project uses "dotenv" npm package to store and use enviroment variables.
Create a .env file in the root folder. Inside this file, the following variables must be declared:

* NODE_ENV   : 'production', 'development', 'test' or 'staging'.
* PORT       : port on which to run the API server.
* DB_NAME    : Name of the database you want to connect to.
* DB_USER    : username with which to connect to the DB.
* DB_PASS    : password of the above given user.
* DB_HOST    : hostname of the server where the DB is located.
* DB_PORT    : port of the DB service.
* JWT_SECRET : The secret key with which to sign your JWT Tokens.
* JWT_ISSUER : The name of the token issuing authority.

> NOTE: You have to provide all the DB_* related variables in `.env` file for the server to run.

## Linting

This project uses ESLint with Airbnb JS style-guide. To use linting, please ensure that you have dev-dependencies installed for this project.

* You can additionally install the VS Code ESLint plugin by Dirk Baeumer.
* To manually check the code, run the command:
```bash
node node_modules/eslint/bin/eslint --ext .js server.js app
```

## Running tests

Uses Mocha adn ChaiJS to run automated tests. You can use the results to integrate with CI/CD tools.
Run the command "npm test" to run the tests.
> Please note that running the tests clears the database. I have configured the scripts and code to use a mock db for the tests.
> In any case, please DO NOT override these settings and run the tests while connected to production database. You have been warned, and such a disaster is in no way, my fault.

Run tests with command:
```bash
npm test
```
